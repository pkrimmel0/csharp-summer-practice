# CSharp Summer Practice
Practice to get ready for summer internships and finding C# work.

## Useful Tips
  - Git
    - `git add` This command *stages* your changes. It makes it so your changes are going to move with you if you change branch. Or are ready to be commited.
    - `git commit` This command commits your changes. The changes will only be commited in the local instance though at this point
    - `git push origin <branchName>` This command takes your local branch and tries to push the changes to the storage location.
  - Dotnet
    - Dotnet is the runtime envrionment for C#. It is used to run any C# app.
    - You can make a dotnet app by running `dotnet new <type>` the command line will give you more information to learn about this.
    - You can run a dotnet app by running `dotnet run` this will run the application once until an exit status is given.
  - C#
    - C# is based in Object Oriented programming. The goal of C# is to view programs as sets of `objects` that interact these `objects` are described in these idea collections called `classes`.
    - In C# you need a `static` entry point called `Main` in your program somewhere for the app to run out of.
    - In C# you can access the details of any classing by hitting `F12` on it.
